# Conditional Probability and Independence

## Summary

This chapter deepens students' understanding of probability by focusing on conditional probability and independence. Students will learn to calculate conditional probabilities, use tree diagrams to solve complex probability problems, and develop intuition for Bayes' theorem. These concepts are essential for understanding statistical inference.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 8 concepts from the learning graph:

162. Conditional Probability
163. Calculating Conditionals
164. Bayes Intuition
165. Tree Diagram
166. Using Tree Diagrams

## Prerequisites

This chapter builds on concepts from:

- [Chapter 2: Displaying Categorical Data](../02-displaying-categorical-data/index.md)
- [Chapter 9: Probability Fundamentals](../09-probability-fundamentals/index.md)
