## Wikipedia Articles

1. [Conditional probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability) - Wikipedia - Thorough explanation of how knowing one event has occurred changes the probability of another event, with the formal definition and numerous worked examples.

2. [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem) - Wikipedia - Covers the theorem that allows us to reverse conditional probabilities, including medical testing examples and the importance of base rates in interpreting results.

3. [Independence (probability theory)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)) - Wikipedia - Explains the mathematical definition of independent events and how to test for independence, clarifying the common confusion with mutually exclusive events.
