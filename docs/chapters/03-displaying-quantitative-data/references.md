1. [Histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram) - Wikipedia - Detailed explanation of histogram construction including bin width selection, variations like frequency polygons, and interpretation guidelines. Includes mathematical foundations and historical development.

2. [Stem-and-leaf display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stem-and-leaf_display) - Wikipedia - Covers stemplot construction, back-to-back stemplots for comparison, and the advantages of preserving original data values. Explains when stemplots are preferred over histograms.

3. [Outlier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier) - Wikipedia - Comprehensive treatment of outliers including detection methods, causes, and how to handle unusual observations. Discusses the impact of outliers on statistical analyses.

## Textbooks

4. **The Practice of Statistics** by Daren S. Starnes, Josh Tabor, and Dan Yates - W.H. Freeman (2018) - Chapter 1 provides thorough coverage of dotplots, stemplots, and histograms with AP-style practice problems. Excellent treatment of describing distributions using shape, center, spread, and outliers.

5. **Statistics in Action** by Ann E. Watkins, Richard L. Scheaffer, and George W. Cobb - Key Curriculum Press (2008) - Activity-based approach to learning data displays. Students construct graphs by hand before using technology, building deeper understanding of how visualizations work.
