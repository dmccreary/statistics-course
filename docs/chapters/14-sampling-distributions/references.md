## Wikipedia Articles

1. [Sampling Distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_distribution) - Wikipedia - Explains how sample statistics vary across repeated samples, covering the sampling distribution of the mean and proportion with visual diagrams and mathematical foundations.

2. [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) - Wikipedia - Comprehensive coverage of this fundamental theorem, explaining why sampling distributions become normal regardless of population shape, with historical context and mathematical proofs.

3. [Standard Error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error) - Wikipedia - Defines standard error as the standard deviation of a sampling distribution, distinguishing it from standard deviation and showing how sample size affects precision.
