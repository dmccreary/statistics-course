# Sampling Distributions

## Summary

This chapter introduces the concept of sampling distributions, which form the theoretical foundation for statistical inference. Students will learn about sampling variability, the sampling distribution of sample proportions and sample means, and the Central Limit Theorem. Understanding these concepts is essential for constructing confidence intervals and performing hypothesis tests.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 17 concepts from the learning graph:

196. Sampling Variability
197. Sampling Distribution
200. Sample Proportion
201. Sampling Dist of Proportion
202. Mean of Sample Proportion
203. SD of Sample Proportion
204. Conditions for Proportion SD
205. Sample Mean
206. Sampling Dist of Mean
207. Mean of Sample Mean
208. SD of Sample Mean
209. Central Limit Theorem
210. CLT Conditions
211. Normal Approximation
212. Statistical Inference
226. Sample Size for CI
