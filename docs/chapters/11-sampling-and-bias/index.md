# Sampling and Bias

## Summary

This chapter covers the principles of collecting data through sampling. Students will learn about different sampling methods (simple random, stratified, cluster, systematic), understand the various sources of bias that can affect data quality, and learn how to design valid surveys. Proper sampling is the foundation of reliable statistical inference.
