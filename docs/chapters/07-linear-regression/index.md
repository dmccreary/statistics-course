# Linear Regression

## Summary

This chapter covers least squares regression, the most important technique for modeling linear relationships between variables. Students will learn to interpret slope and y-intercept, make predictions, calculate and analyze residuals, understand the coefficient of determination (R²), and identify influential points and outliers in regression.
