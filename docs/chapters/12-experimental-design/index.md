# Experimental Design

## Summary

This chapter covers the principles of designing experiments to establish causal relationships. Students will learn about experimental units, treatments, factors, and levels. Key principles include control, randomization, replication, and blinding. Understanding good experimental design enables students to critically evaluate scientific claims.
