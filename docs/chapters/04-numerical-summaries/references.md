## Wikipedia Articles

1. [Mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean) - Wikipedia - Comprehensive coverage of the arithmetic mean and related concepts. Explains the mean as a balance point and discusses when the mean is an appropriate measure of center.

2. [Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) - Wikipedia - Detailed explanation of standard deviation including formulas, interpretation, and relationship to variance. Covers both population and sample calculations with clear examples.

3. [Box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot) - Wikipedia - Explains boxplot construction including the five-number summary, whiskers, and outlier detection using the 1.5 IQR rule. Includes variations like notched boxplots and violin plots.

## Textbooks

4. **The Practice of Statistics** by Daren S. Starnes, Josh Tabor, and Dan Yates - W.H. Freeman (2018) - Chapters 1-2 provide thorough coverage of numerical summaries including mean, median, quartiles, standard deviation, and boxplots. The emphasis on interpretation over calculation aligns well with AP exam expectations.

5. **Introduction to the Practice of Statistics** by David S. Moore, George P. McCabe, and Bruce A. Craig - W.H. Freeman (2017) - College-level text with clear explanations of descriptive statistics. Excellent treatment of when to use resistant versus non-resistant measures based on distribution shape.
