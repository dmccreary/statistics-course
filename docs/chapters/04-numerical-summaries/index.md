# Numerical Summaries

## Summary

This chapter introduces the numerical measures used to describe distributions. Students will learn about measures of center (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (range, IQR, standard deviation, variance), and how to calculate and interpret these statistics. The five-number summary and boxplots provide powerful tools for comparing distributions.
