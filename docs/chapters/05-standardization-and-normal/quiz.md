# Quiz: Standardization and Normal Distributions

Test your understanding of z-scores, the normal distribution, and the Empirical Rule with these review questions.

---

#### 1. A student scored 72 on a test where the mean was 80 and the standard deviation was 8. What is this student's z-score?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. -8
2. -1
3. 0.5
4. 1
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Using the z-score formula: \( z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} = \frac{72 - 80}{8} = \frac{-8}{8} = -1 \). This means the student scored exactly one standard deviation below the mean. The negative sign indicates the score is below average.

#### 2. What does it mean when a data value has a z-score of 0?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The value is an outlier
2. The value equals the standard deviation
3. The value equals the mean
4. The value cannot be compared to other values
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A z-score of 0 means the value is exactly at the mean. When you substitute into the z-score formula, if x equals the mean, the numerator becomes zero, making the entire z-score equal to zero. This is true regardless of the standard deviation.

#### 3. According to the Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7 Rule), what percentage of data in a normal distribution falls within two standard deviations of the mean?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 68%
2. 95%
3. 99.7%
4. 100%
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. The Empirical Rule states that for normal distributions, approximately 68% of data falls within 1 standard deviation, 95% within 2 standard deviations, and 99.7% within 3 standard deviations of the mean. This leaves about 5% in the tails (2.5% in each tail).

#### 4. Which of the following is NOT a property of all normal distributions?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. They are symmetric about the mean
2. The mean, median, and mode are all equal
3. The total area under the curve equals 1
4. They have a standard deviation of 1
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **D**. Normal distributions can have any positive standard deviation. Only the standard normal distribution has a standard deviation of 1. All normal distributions share the other properties: symmetry about the mean, equal mean/median/mode, and total area of 1 under the curve.

#### 5. Student A scored 85 on a test with mean 78 and standard deviation 7. Student B scored 92 on a different test with mean 88 and standard deviation 8. Which student performed better relative to their class?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Student A, because 85 is closer to the mean
2. Student A, because z = 1.0 is greater than z = 0.5
3. Student B, because 92 is a higher raw score
4. They performed equally well
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. Student A's z-score: \( z = \frac{85-78}{7} = 1.0 \). Student B's z-score: \( z = \frac{92-88}{8} = 0.5 \). Student A performed one full standard deviation above the mean, while Student B was only half a standard deviation above. Raw scores can't be compared directly across different tests; z-scores allow fair comparison.

#### 6. On a normal probability plot (QQ plot), what pattern indicates that the data is approximately normally distributed?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. Points follow a curved pattern
2. Points are scattered randomly
3. Points follow approximately a straight line
4. Points cluster at the extremes
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. A normal probability plot graphs each data value against the z-score it would have if the data were perfectly normal. When data is approximately normal, the points fall along a straight line. Curved patterns indicate skewness, while scattered points suggest the data doesn't follow any standard distribution.

#### 7. If the area under a normal curve to the left of z = 1.5 is 0.9332, what is the area to the right of z = 1.5?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 0.0668
2. 0.4332
3. 0.5000
4. 0.9332
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **A**. Since the total area under any density curve equals 1, the area to the right equals 1 minus the area to the left: 1 - 0.9332 = 0.0668. This means about 6.68% of values in a standard normal distribution are greater than z = 1.5.

#### 8. Heights of adult women are normally distributed with mean 64.5 inches and standard deviation 2.5 inches. What height marks the 90th percentile (the top 10%)?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 61.3 inches
2. 64.5 inches
3. 67.7 inches
4. 70.0 inches
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. For the 90th percentile, we need the z-score with area 0.90 to its left, which is approximately z = 1.28. Converting back to the original scale: x = 64.5 + (1.28)(2.5) = 64.5 + 3.2 = 67.7 inches. This is an inverse normal calculation where we work backwards from probability to value.

#### 9. A density curve is drawn so that the area between x = 10 and x = 20 is 0.35. What does this value represent?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. The mean of the distribution is 0.35
2. 35% of observations fall between 10 and 20
3. The height of the curve at x = 15 is 0.35
4. The standard deviation is 0.35
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **B**. For density curves, area under the curve represents proportion or probability. An area of 0.35 between x = 10 and x = 20 means that 35% of all observations in this distribution fall within that range. This is a fundamental property of all density curves.

#### 10. SAT scores are approximately normal with mean 1060 and standard deviation 195. Using the Empirical Rule, approximately what percentage of students score between 865 and 1255?

<div class="upper-alpha" markdown>
1. 34%
2. 47.5%
3. 68%
4. 95%
</div>

??? question "Show Answer"
    The correct answer is **C**. First, calculate how many standard deviations these boundaries are from the mean: 1060 - 195 = 865 and 1060 + 195 = 1255. These are exactly one standard deviation below and above the mean. According to the Empirical Rule, 68% of data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.
