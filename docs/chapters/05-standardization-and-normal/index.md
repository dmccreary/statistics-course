# Standardization and Normal Distributions

## Summary

This chapter covers standardization using z-scores and the normal distribution, one of the most important probability distributions in statistics. Students will learn to calculate and interpret z-scores, understand the properties of normal curves, apply the Empirical Rule, and use normal tables and technology to find probabilities. These skills are essential for inference procedures later in the course.
