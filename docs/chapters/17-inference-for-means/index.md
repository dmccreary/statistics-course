# Inference for Means

## Summary

This chapter extends inference procedures to population means using t-distributions. Students will learn about the t-distribution and its properties, construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests for one-sample and two-sample means, and understand when to use paired t-procedures. The robustness of t-procedures and their conditions are emphasized.

## Concepts Covered

This chapter covers the following 18 concepts from the learning graph:

251. T-Distribution
252. T vs Z Distribution
253. Degrees of Freedom
254. T Critical Values
255. One-Sample T-Interval
256. Conditions for T-Procedures
257. One-Sample T-Test
258. Two-Sample T-Interval
259. Two-Sample T-Test
260. Pooled vs Unpooled
261. Paired T-Test
262. Paired Data
263. When to Pair
264. Robustness
280. Regression Model
281. Slope Parameter
284. Standard Error of Slope
