# Chi-Square and Regression Inference

## Summary

This chapter covers chi-square tests and inference for regression. Students will learn to perform goodness-of-fit tests, tests for homogeneity, and tests for independence using chi-square distributions. The chapter also covers inference for the slope of a regression line, including conditions and interpretation.
