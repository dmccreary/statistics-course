## Wikipedia Articles

1. [Categorical variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable) - Wikipedia - Explains categorical (qualitative) variables including nominal and ordinal types. Provides context for understanding when data represents categories rather than numerical measurements.

2. [Bar chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_chart) - Wikipedia - Comprehensive coverage of bar graphs including construction, variations like grouped and stacked bars, and best practices for effective visualization. Includes historical context and common uses.

3. [Pie chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart) - Wikipedia - Discusses pie chart construction, appropriate uses, and limitations. Covers the ongoing debate about when pie charts are effective versus when bar charts are preferred.

## Textbooks

4. **The Practice of Statistics** by Daren S. Starnes, Josh Tabor, and Dan Yates - W.H. Freeman (2018) - Chapter 1 covers categorical data displays including frequency tables and bar graphs. The treatment of two-way tables and conditional distributions in later chapters provides excellent exam preparation.

5. **Stats: Modeling the World** by David E. Bock, Paul F. Velleman, and Richard D. De Veaux - Pearson (2019) - Features engaging explanations of categorical data analysis with memorable real-world examples. The sections on association and Simpson's Paradox are particularly well-written.
