# Course Description Quality Assessment

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Course:** AP Statistics
**Quality Score:** 100/100

## Summary

The AP Statistics course description is **excellent** and fully meets all requirements for generating a comprehensive learning graph with 200+ concepts.

## Scoring Breakdown

| Element | Points | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| **Title** | 5/5 | "AP Statistics" - clear and descriptive |
| **Target Audience** | 5/5 | High-school students preparing for AP exam, with relevant fields of interest listed |
| **Prerequisites** | 5/5 | Algebra I and II, graphing skills, numerical reasoning - clearly stated; explicitly notes calculus is NOT required |
| **Main Topics Covered** | 10/10 | 9 comprehensive units with detailed subtopics covering the full AP Statistics curriculum |
| **Topics Excluded** | 5/5 | Clear "Concepts NOT Covered" section listing 9 exclusions (Bayesian inference, time series, etc.) |
| **Learning Outcomes Header** | 5/5 | Properly structured with "Learning Objectives Sorted by the Six Levels of the 2001 Bloom Taxonomy" |
| **Remember Level** | 10/10 | 4 specific, actionable outcomes (recall definitions, identify variable types, recognize symbols, recall formulas) |
| **Understand Level** | 10/10 | 4 specific outcomes (explain distributions, interpret graphs, describe sampling purpose, explain confidence intervals) |
| **Apply Level** | 10/10 | 5 specific outcomes (construct graphs, calculate probabilities, perform CI calculations, conduct hypothesis tests, use technology) |
| **Analyze Level** | 10/10 | 5 specific outcomes (compare distributions, distinguish correlation/causation, evaluate study design, analyze residuals, check assumptions) |
| **Evaluate Level** | 10/10 | 5 specific outcomes (assess methods, critique conclusions, judge evidence strength, evaluate limitations, interpret practical significance) |
| **Create Level** | 10/10 | 5 specific outcomes including capstone ideas (design studies, develop arguments, write reports, communicate findings, propose improvements) |
| **Descriptive Context** | 5/5 | Excellent overview emphasizing statistical thinking, real-world data, and conceptual understanding |

**Total: 100/100**

## Strengths

1. **Complete Bloom's Taxonomy Coverage**: All six cognitive levels are represented with 3-5 specific outcomes each
2. **Clear Scope Definition**: Both included and excluded topics are explicitly listed
3. **Well-Structured Units**: 9 units align with the College Board AP Statistics framework
4. **Real-World Emphasis**: Consistent focus on data-driven reasoning and practical applications
5. **Appropriate Prerequisites**: Clearly states what students need (and don't need - calculus)

## Estimated Concept Count

Based on this course description, I estimate we can generate **200+ distinct concepts** covering:

- ~25 foundational concepts (variables, data types, basic terminology)
- ~35 exploratory data analysis concepts (graphs, summaries, distributions)
- ~25 study design and data collection concepts
- ~30 probability and random variable concepts
- ~25 sampling distribution concepts
- ~40 inference concepts (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, chi-square, regression)
- ~20 interpretation and communication concepts

## Comparison with Similar Courses

This course description is **above average** compared to typical AP Statistics course descriptions:

- Most AP Statistics syllabi have 5-7 units; this has 9 well-defined units
- Learning outcomes are often vague; these are specific and measurable
- Exclusions are rarely documented; this clearly defines scope boundaries

## Recommendation

**Proceed with learning graph generation.** This course description provides an excellent foundation for creating a comprehensive, pedagogically sound learning graph.
