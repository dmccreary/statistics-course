# Glossary Quality Report

Generated: 2026-02-07

## Overview

This report assesses the quality of the AP Statistics glossary against ISO 11179 metadata registry standards.

## Summary Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total terms defined | 300 |
| Terms with examples | ~210 (70%) |
| Terms with cross-references | ~85 (28%) |
| Circular definitions found | 0 |
| Average definition length | 28 words |
| Alphabetical ordering | 100% compliant |

## ISO 11179 Compliance Metrics

### Precision (25 points each)

Definitions accurately capture the concept's meaning within the AP Statistics context.

- **Score: 24/25**
- All definitions are contextually accurate for the AP Statistics course
- Terms are defined at the appropriate level for high school students

### Conciseness (25 points each)

Definitions are brief, targeting 20-50 words.

- **Score: 23/25**
- Average definition length: 28 words
- Range: 15-55 words
- Some complex statistical concepts require slightly longer explanations

### Distinctiveness (25 points each)

Each definition is unique and distinguishable.

- **Score: 25/25**
- No duplicate definitions found
- Related concepts are clearly distinguished (e.g., Parameter vs. Statistic, Type I vs. Type II Error)
- Cross-references help clarify relationships

### Non-circularity (25 points each)

Definitions avoid circular dependencies.

- **Score: 25/25**
- No circular definitions detected
- Terms are defined using simpler, more fundamental concepts
- Chain analysis verified: no A→B→A patterns

## Overall Quality Score: 97/100

## Example Coverage Analysis

Examples were added to approximately 70% of terms, prioritizing:

1. **Foundational concepts** (Variable, Data, Population, Sample)
2. **Complex procedures** (Hypothesis Test, Confidence Interval)
3. **Commonly confused terms** (Correlation vs Causation, Type I vs Type II Error)
4. **Distribution concepts** (Normal, Skewed, Bimodal)
5. **Inference procedures** (Z-test, T-test, Chi-square)

### Example Quality

Examples follow these guidelines:
- Use realistic scenarios from the course context
- Reference Sylvia's acorn examples where appropriate
- Connect to student experiences (test scores, heights, study time)
- Illustrate the concept without adding confusion

## Cross-Reference Analysis

Cross-references include:

| Type | Count | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| See also | 65 | Related concepts to explore |
| Contrast with | 20 | Opposing or easily confused concepts |

### Key Cross-Reference Pairs

- Parameter ↔ Statistic
- Population ↔ Sample
- Mean ↔ Median ↔ Mode
- Type I Error ↔ Type II Error
- Null Hypothesis ↔ Alternative Hypothesis
- Observational Study ↔ Experiment
- Discrete Variable ↔ Continuous Variable
- Stratified Random Sample ↔ Cluster Sample
- Biased Estimator ↔ Unbiased Estimator
- Statistical Significance ↔ Practical Significance

## Readability Assessment

- **Target audience:** High school students (grades 11-12)
- **Reading level:** Appropriate for AP course (Flesch-Kincaid grade level ~11)
- **Technical vocabulary:** Introduced progressively with clear explanations
- **Jargon:** Minimal; when used, defined in context

## Recommendations

### Minor Improvements

1. Consider adding more examples to abstract mathematical concepts (e.g., some probability rules)
2. Some compound terms (e.g., "SD of Sample Mean") could include the full terminology as well as abbreviations

### Content Verification

All 300 concepts from the concept list are included:

- Concepts 1-50: Foundational statistics and data display ✓
- Concepts 51-100: Distributions, z-scores, and bivariate data ✓
- Concepts 101-150: Study design and probability ✓
- Concepts 151-200: Random variables and sampling distributions ✓
- Concepts 201-250: Inference procedures ✓
- Concepts 251-300: Advanced inference and synthesis ✓

## Validation Checklist

- [x] All 300 concepts defined
- [x] Alphabetical ordering verified
- [x] No circular definitions
- [x] Cross-references verified (all referenced terms exist)
- [x] Examples contextually appropriate
- [x] Markdown syntax renders correctly
- [x] Navigation link verified in mkdocs.yml

## Usage Notes

The glossary is designed to:

1. **Serve as a reference** for students reviewing concepts
2. **Support quick lookups** during problem-solving
3. **Reinforce learning** through examples and cross-references
4. **Prepare for exams** by providing precise, AP-aligned definitions

Students should use the glossary alongside chapter content, not as a replacement for it. Sylvia's conversational teaching in the chapters provides the context and depth needed for true understanding.
