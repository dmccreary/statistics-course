## Category Descriptions

### FOUND - Foundations
Core building blocks including: statistics, data, variables (categorical, quantitative, discrete, continuous), population, sample, parameter, statistic. These concepts have few or no dependencies.

### EDA1 - Univariate Analysis
Exploratory data analysis for single variables: distributions, graphical displays (histograms, boxplots, stemplots), measures of center (mean, median, mode), measures of spread (range, IQR, standard deviation), shape descriptions, outliers, normal distributions, z-scores.

### EDA2 - Bivariate Analysis
Two-variable relationships: two-way tables, marginal and conditional distributions, scatterplots, direction/form/strength of association, correlation coefficient.

### REG - Regression
Linear modeling: least squares regression, regression equation, slope and intercept interpretation, residuals, residual plots, coefficient of determination (R²), influential points, extrapolation dangers.

### STUDY - Study Design
Data collection methods: observational studies vs experiments, treatments, random assignment, experimental designs (completely randomized, randomized block, matched pairs), blinding, confounding, sampling methods (SRS, stratified, cluster, systematic), bias types.

### PROB - Probability
Probability foundations: sample space, events, probability rules (addition, multiplication), conditional probability, independence, tree diagrams, Venn diagrams, simulation, Law of Large Numbers.

### RAND - Random Variables
Random variable theory: discrete random variables, probability distributions, expected value, variance, combining random variables, binomial distribution, geometric distribution.

### SAMP - Sampling Distributions
Sampling theory: sampling variability, sampling distributions of proportions and means, unbiased estimators, Central Limit Theorem, normal approximation.

### CIPR - CI for Proportions
Inference for proportions (confidence intervals): point estimates, margin of error, confidence level, critical values, standard error, conditions, interpretation, sample size determination.

### HTPR - HT for Proportions
Hypothesis testing fundamentals: null and alternative hypotheses, test statistics, p-values, significance level, Type I and II errors, power, tests for one and two proportions.

### TMEA - T-Procedures for Means
T-distribution based inference: degrees of freedom, one-sample and two-sample t-intervals, one-sample and two-sample t-tests, paired t-procedures, robustness.

### CHISQ - Chi-Square Tests
Categorical data inference: chi-square distribution, chi-square statistic, expected and observed counts, goodness-of-fit test, test for homogeneity, test for independence.

### REGF - Regression Inference
Inference for regression: t-interval and t-test for slope, standard error of slope, conditions for regression inference (LINE), interpreting regression output.

### COMM - Communication
Statistical communication: practical vs statistical significance, effect size, study limitations, generalizability, report writing, four-step inference process, AP exam strategies.
