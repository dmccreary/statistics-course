      "answer": "A confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for a population parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval might be (0.52, 0.72). This means if we repeated our sampling process many times, about 95% of the resulting intervals would contain the true parameter. It quantifies uncertainty about estimates.",
