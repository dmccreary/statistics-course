# AP Statistics

## Audience

This course is designed for high-school students who are preparing for the **AP Statistics examination** and who wish to earn college credit or advanced placement for an introductory, non-calculus-based statistics course.  
It is appropriate for students interested in mathematics, science, social science, business, health sciences, engineering, data science, and any field where data-driven reasoning is essential.

The course emphasizes **statistical thinking, data analysis, and interpretation**, rather than algebraic manipulation or formal proofs.

---

## Prerequisites

Students should have successfully completed:

- A full sequence of high-school algebra (Algebra I and II)
- Experience with linear functions, systems of equations, and basic function interpretation
- Comfort with graphing and numerical reasoning

Calculus is **not required** and is **not used** in this course.

---

## Overview

AP Statistics introduces students to the **major concepts and tools used for collecting, analyzing, and drawing conclusions from data**. The course follows the framework defined by the :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} and is designed to be equivalent to a **one-semester, introductory college statistics course**.

Students learn to explore data, design studies, understand probability, model randomness, and perform statistical inference. A strong emphasis is placed on **real-world data**, **conceptual understanding**, **communication of results**, and **statistical reasoning** rather than formula memorization.

Throughout the course, students are expected to justify conclusions, assess assumptions, interpret results in context, and recognize the limitations of statistical methods.
