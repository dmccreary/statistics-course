## Description

This interactive concept map helps students understand the fundamental classification of variables in statistics. The hierarchical structure clearly shows how variables branch into two main categories:

- **Categorical Variables**: Variables that name categories or groups, where values are labels rather than numbers (like eye color, zip code, or blood type)
- **Quantitative Variables**: Variables with numerical values that represent quantities or amounts

Quantitative variables are further subdivided into:

- **Discrete Variables**: Can only take specific, countable values (often integers), like the number of children or cars owned
- **Continuous Variables**: Can take any value within a range, including decimals, like height, weight, or temperature

### Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any node to see its definition and 3-4 examples
- **Click** on a node to highlight its branch (ancestors and descendants) while dimming other nodes
- **Click again** on the same node to clear the selection and show all branches

The color-coded branches help reinforce the classification structure:

- Purple/indigo for the root "Variable" node
- Green for the Categorical branch
- Orange/yellow shades for the Quantitative branch and its children

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will be able to classify variables into categorical and quantitative types, and further subdivide quantitative variables into discrete and continuous.

### Grade Level

High School (AP Statistics) or Undergraduate Introduction to Statistics

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of what data and variables are
- Basic familiarity with numbers vs. categories

### Duration

15-20 minutes

### Activities

1. **Exploration (5 minutes)**: Have students hover over each node to read definitions and examples. Ask them to notice the hierarchical structure.

2. **Classification Practice (10 minutes)**: Present the following variables and have students classify each:
   - Number of siblings (Quantitative - Discrete)
   - Favorite sport (Categorical)
   - Time to run a mile (Quantitative - Continuous)
   - Letter grade (Categorical)
   - Temperature in Fahrenheit (Quantitative - Continuous)
   - Number of text messages sent today (Quantitative - Discrete)

3. **Discussion (5 minutes)**: Ask students why it matters whether a variable is categorical vs. quantitative, or discrete vs. continuous. Connect to how we might display and analyze each type differently.

### Assessment Questions

1. What is the key difference between categorical and quantitative variables?
2. Give an example of a discrete variable that is NOT a count.
3. Can a variable that uses numbers (like zip codes) be categorical? Explain.
4. Why might the same characteristic be measured as discrete or continuous depending on how we collect the data?

### Extension

Have students create their own examples for each category from a dataset they encounter in their daily lives (sports statistics, social media metrics, health data, etc.).
