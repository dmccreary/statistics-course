## About This MicroSim

Calculate probabilities for normal distributions with interactive visualization.

### How to Use
- Select **query type**: P(X < a), P(X > a), or P(a < X < b)
- **Drag** the orange marker(s) to change boundary values
- Adjust **μ** and **σ** sliders to change distribution parameters
- See both z-scores and probabilities update in real time

### Key Insights
- **Left-tail probability** P(X < a): Area from negative infinity to a
- **Right-tail probability** P(X > a): Area from a to positive infinity
- **Between probability** P(a < X < b): Area between two values
- Probabilities are shown as both decimals and percentages
- Z-scores show how many SDs each value is from the mean

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will calculate and interpret probabilities from normal distributions using the standard normal curve (Bloom's Taxonomy: Applying, Analyzing).
