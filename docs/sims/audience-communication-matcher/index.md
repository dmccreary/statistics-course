## About This MicroSim

*"Now that's a data point worth collecting!"* Sylvia exclaims. *"Knowing how to DO statistics is only half the battle. The other half is knowing how to COMMUNICATE your findings to different audiences. Let's practice!"*

This interactive matching game presents the same statistical finding in four different ways, each appropriate for a different audience:

### The Four Audiences

| Audience | What They Need | Style |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| **Statistics Professor** | Technical details, methodology, formulas | Highly technical |
| **Business Manager** | Practical implications, bottom line | Business-focused |
| **Newspaper Reader** | Simple takeaway, accessible language | Plain English |
| **AP Exam Grader** | Complete reasoning, correct terminology | Structured, formal |

## How to Use

1. **Read the statistical finding** at the top
2. **Drag each explanation card** to the matching audience
3. **Click "Check Answers"** when all cards are placed
4. **Review feedback** - green means correct, red means incorrect
5. **Click "Next Round"** to try a new scenario

## Key Insights

*"Here's the thing,"* Sylvia says thoughtfully. *"A great explanation for one audience might be confusing or inappropriate for another. Learning to adapt your communication is a superpower!"*

### Communication Strategies by Audience

**For Statistics Professors:**
- Use proper notation (H₀, α, μ)
- Name the test used
- Report full statistical output

**For Business Managers:**
- Focus on the practical impact
- Translate numbers to decisions
- Avoid unnecessary jargon

**For Newspaper Readers:**
- Lead with the conclusion
- Use everyday language
- Round numbers appropriately

**For AP Exam Graders:**
- Follow the four-step process
- Use key phrases ("convincing evidence")
- State conclusions in context

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Identify the communication needs of different audiences
2. Differentiate between technical and accessible explanations
3. Adapt the same statistical finding to multiple audiences
4. Recognize appropriate vs. inappropriate communication styles
5. Write clear statistical reports tailored to specific readers

### Target Audience

- AP Statistics students (high school)
- Introductory statistics college students
- Science communication students
- Anyone learning to present data effectively

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of hypothesis testing and confidence intervals
- Familiarity with statistical terminology
- Basic knowledge of the four-step inference process

### Classroom Activities

**Activity 1: Play the Game (15 minutes)**

1. Have students work through all three scenarios
2. Discuss which matches were hardest and why
3. Identify the key features that distinguish each audience's needs

**Activity 2: Write Your Own (15 minutes)**

Present a new finding:
- "A study of 500 employees found those with standing desks took 12% fewer sick days (p = 0.03)"

Have students write four versions for each audience.

**Activity 3: Critique Real Examples (10 minutes)**

Show students actual press releases about research findings. Ask:

- Who was the intended audience?
- Was the communication appropriate?
- What would you change?

*"Time to squirrel away this knowledge!"* Sylvia concludes. *"The best statisticians are also great communicators."*

### Assessment Questions

1. A study finds that students who eat breakfast score 5 points higher on tests (p = 0.04, 95% CI: 1 to 9 points). Write one sentence for a newspaper reader.

2. Why might saying "we rejected the null hypothesis" be inappropriate for a business audience?

3. An AP exam response concludes "the data shows the treatment works." What's wrong with this, and how would you fix it?

4. A researcher says "r = 0.73, p < 0.001" to a newspaper reporter. How should they rephrase this?

5. What key phrases should appear in an AP Statistics exam response but NOT in a newspaper article?
