## About This MicroSim

Build boxplots interactively and understand how each component relates to the five-number summary.

### How to Use
- **Drag** data points to see the boxplot update in real-time
- Click **Build Step-by-Step** to see the construction process
- Choose different distribution types (symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed)
- Toggle **Labels** and **Table** to customize the display

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will construct and interpret boxplots by connecting numerical summary statistics to their visual representation (Bloom's Taxonomy: Applying, Creating).

### Activities
1. Build a boxplot step-by-step to understand each component
2. Create symmetric vs. skewed distributions and observe the boxplot shape
3. Predict how moving a point will change the boxplot before dragging it
