## About This MicroSim

Assess whether data follows a normal distribution by comparing histograms and normal probability plots (QQ plots).

### How to Use
- Select a **dataset type**: Approximately Normal, Right Skewed, Left Skewed, Heavy Tails, Light Tails, Uniform, or Bimodal
- Adjust **sample size** (n) slider from 20 to 200
- Click **New Sample** to generate fresh random data
- Toggle **Ref Line** to show/hide the reference line on QQ plot
- Toggle **Overlay** to show/hide ideal normal curve on histogram

### Key Insights
- **Normal data**: Points cluster tightly around the reference line in QQ plot
- **Right-skewed**: Points curve upward at the right end
- **Left-skewed**: Points curve downward at the left end
- **Heavy tails**: S-shaped curve (deviations at both ends)
- **Light tails**: Points cluster more tightly than expected
- The "Normality Verdict" provides automatic assessment with explanation

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will assess whether data follows a normal distribution by interpreting histograms and normal probability plots (Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyzing, Evaluating).
