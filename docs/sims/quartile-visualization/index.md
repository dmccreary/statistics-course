## About This MicroSim

This visualization shows how **quartiles** divide a distribution into four equal parts:
- **Q1 (First Quartile)**: 25% of data falls below this value
- **Q2 (Median)**: 50% of data falls below this value
- **Q3 (Third Quartile)**: 75% of data falls below this value

### How to Use
- Adjust the **Sample Size** slider to see how quartiles change with more or fewer points
- Click **Randomize** to generate a new random dataset
- Toggle between **Even Spacing** and **Realistic Data** modes
- **Hover** over regions to highlight them
- **Click** on Q1, Median, or Q3 markers to see calculation details

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will identify and interpret quartiles as values that divide a distribution into four equal parts (Bloom's Taxonomy: Understanding).

### Discussion Questions
1. Why does each colored region contain approximately 25% of the data?
2. What happens to the quartile positions when you increase the sample size?
3. How would outliers affect the quartile positions?
