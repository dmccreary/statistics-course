## About This MicroSim

*"Time to squirrel away this knowledge!"* Sylvia cheers. *"Everything we've learned about sampling comes together here. Can you spot the problems that make a survey unreliable?"*

This interactive tool presents real-world survey scenarios and challenges students to identify the methodological problems. It's a practical application of all the bias and design concepts covered in Chapter 11.

### Problem Categories

| Category | Issues to Identify |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Sampling Method** | Convenience sample, Voluntary response |
| **Coverage Issues** | Undercoverage, Nonresponse bias, Bad timing |
| **Question Wording** | Loaded language, Leading questions, Double-barreled |

## How to Use

1. **Read the scenario** describing a survey situation
2. **Check all problems** you can identify from the checklist
3. **Click "Check Answers"** to see if you found them all
4. **Review the explanation** to understand why each issue matters
5. **Click "Next →"** to try another scenario

### The Four Scenarios

1. **Magazine Reader Survey** — Classic voluntary response
2. **Teen Social Media Study** — Convenience sample and undercoverage
3. **Political Opinion Poll** — Loaded and leading question wording
4. **Community Health Survey** — Multiple coverage issues

## Key Concepts

### Evaluating Any Survey

When you encounter a survey in the news or research, ask:

**About Sampling:**
- Who was actually asked? (sampling frame)
- How were they selected? (random or convenience?)
- Could anyone choose to participate? (voluntary response?)

**About Coverage:**
- Who might be missing? (undercoverage)
- Who might not respond? (nonresponse)
- When and how was contact made? (accessibility)

**About Questions:**
- Is the wording neutral? (no loaded terms)
- Does it suggest an answer? (not leading)
- Does it ask one thing at a time? (not double-barreled)

*"Good surveys don't just happen,"* Sylvia reminds us. *"Every choice—from who you sample to how you phrase questions—affects the quality of your data."*

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Apply survey design principles to evaluate real-world scenarios
2. Identify multiple types of bias in a single survey
3. Explain why each identified problem affects validity
4. Suggest improvements to flawed survey designs

### Target Audience

- AP Statistics students (high school)
- Introductory statistics college students
- Research methods courses
- Media literacy education

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of sampling methods (SRS, convenience, voluntary response)
- Knowledge of bias types (undercoverage, nonresponse, response)
- Familiarity with question wording issues

### Classroom Activities

**Activity 1: Solo Practice (15 minutes)**

Students work through all four scenarios independently, recording their answers and scores.

**Activity 2: Pair Discussion (10 minutes)**

Partners compare which issues they identified and which they missed. Discuss disagreements.

**Activity 3: Design Improvement (15 minutes)**

For each scenario, students propose specific fixes:

1. Magazine survey → Random sample from subscriber list with follow-ups
2. Teen study → Stratified sample across multiple school types
3. Political poll → Rewrite with neutral language
4. Health survey → Multiple languages, cell phones, evening calls

### Extension Activities

**Create Your Own Scenario:**
Students write a survey scenario with intentional flaws for classmates to identify.

**Real-World Analysis:**
Bring in actual survey results from news articles. Students evaluate the methodology.

**Fix It Workshop:**
Given a flawed survey, students redesign it to eliminate all identified problems.

### Assessment Questions

1. A website asks visitors to click a button to share their opinion on a new product. What type of sampling is this? What bias is most likely?

2. List three specific questions you would ask to evaluate whether a survey result reported in the news is trustworthy.

3. A survey about transportation preferences is conducted at a train station during rush hour. Identify at least two problems with this approach.

4. Explain why a survey can have multiple bias issues simultaneously, and why each issue makes the results less reliable.
