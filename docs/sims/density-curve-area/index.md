## About This MicroSim

Explore how the **area under a density curve** represents probability.

### How to Use
- **Drag** the vertical boundary lines to change the shaded region
- Select different **curve types**: Normal, Uniform, Right-skewed
- Toggle **Show Full Area = 1** to see that the total area always equals 1

### Key Insights
- The area under a density curve between two values represents the proportion/probability
- The total area under any density curve equals exactly 1 (100%)
- Different curve shapes have different area distributions

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will understand that area under a density curve represents probability by shading regions and observing the corresponding proportions (Bloom's Taxonomy: Understanding).
