## About This MicroSim

Explore the relationship between the mean and median in different distribution shapes.

### How to Use
- Click **Symmetric**, **Right-skewed**, or **Left-skewed** to see preset distributions
- Add **outliers** to see how they affect the mean (but not the median!)
- Observe how the relationship changes: Mean > Median, Mean < Median, or Mean ≈ Median

### Key Insights
- **Symmetric**: Mean ≈ Median
- **Right-skewed**: Mean > Median (pulled toward the long right tail)
- **Left-skewed**: Mean < Median (pulled toward the long left tail)
- The median is **resistant** to outliers; the mean is not

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will predict the relative positions of mean and median based on distribution shape (Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyzing, Evaluating).
