## About This MicroSim

Walk through the calculation of variance and standard deviation step by step.

### How to Use
- Click **Next Step** to advance through each calculation step
- Click **Show All** to see the complete solution
- Toggle between **Sample (n-1)** and **Population (n)** formulas
- Choose different **preset datasets** to practice with

### The Six Steps
1. Calculate the mean
2. Find each deviation from the mean
3. Square each deviation
4. Sum the squared deviations
5. Divide by (n-1) for sample variance
6. Take the square root for standard deviation

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will calculate variance and standard deviation by following a systematic procedure and understanding each step's purpose (Bloom's Taxonomy: Applying, Understanding).
