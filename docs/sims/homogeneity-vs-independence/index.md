## About This MicroSim

Master the difference between chi-square tests for homogeneity and tests for independence! These two tests look similar but answer fundamentally different questions based on how data was collected.

### How to Use

- **Compare Both**: View both test types side-by-side to see the key differences
- **Homogeneity Only**: Focus on the homogeneity test details
- **Independence Only**: Focus on the independence test details
- **Practice Quiz**: Test your understanding with real scenarios!

### The Key Difference

| Feature | Homogeneity Test | Independence Test |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|
| Sampling | Separate samples from each population | One sample, two variables measured |
| Question | Same distribution across groups? | Are the two variables related? |
| Populations | Multiple (compare them) | One (explore relationships) |
| Variables | One categorical variable | Two categorical variables |

### Why It Matters

Both tests use the same chi-square formula and expected count calculation, but the interpretation is completely different. Choosing the wrong test type leads to incorrect conclusions!

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will distinguish between tests for homogeneity and tests for independence by comparing their setups, hypotheses, and interpretations (Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyzing).

### The Memory Trick

- **Homogeneity** = "Homo" means "same" = Are the distributions the SAME across groups?
- **Independence** = Are the variables INDEPENDENT of each other?

### Warmup Activity (3 minutes)

Ask students: "If I survey students from three different schools about their favorite lunch, which type of test would I use?" (Homogeneity - separate samples from different populations)

### Main Activity (12 minutes)

1. Start with **Compare Both** view
2. Walk through the visual differences in sampling design
3. Read the examples aloud and identify why each is its test type
4. Switch to **Practice Quiz** mode
5. Work through scenarios as a class

### Discussion Questions

- Why do both tests use the same formula if they're different?
- How could you redesign a homogeneity study to make it an independence study?
- What happens if you collect data one way but analyze it with the wrong test?

### Common Mistakes

1. Assuming any two-way table uses an independence test
2. Forgetting that homogeneity requires separate random samples
3. Confusing "multiple groups" with "two variables"
