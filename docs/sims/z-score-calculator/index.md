## About This MicroSim

Calculate and visualize z-scores with an interactive normal distribution curve.

### How to Use
- **Drag** the marker along the curve to change the raw value (x)
- Use **preset buttons** to load different real-world examples (IQ, SAT, Heights)
- Adjust **μ (mean)** and **σ (standard deviation)** sliders to change distribution parameters
- Watch the z-score calculation update in real time

### Key Insights
- **Z-score formula**: z = (x - μ) / σ
- Z-score tells you how many standard deviations a value is from the mean
- Positive z-scores are above the mean; negative z-scores are below
- |z| < 2 is typical; |z| > 2 is unusual; |z| > 3 is very rare

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will calculate z-scores from raw values and interpret their meaning in the context of a normal distribution (Bloom's Taxonomy: Applying, Analyzing).
