## About This MicroSim

Visualize the **Empirical Rule** (also called the 68-95-99.7 Rule) for normal distributions.

### How to Use
- Click **1σ**, **2σ**, or **3σ** buttons to see cumulative regions
- Each click animates the region filling from the mean outward
- Use **◀ ▶** arrows to switch between real-world examples (IQ, Heights, Test Scores)
- Click **Animate** to see all three regions build sequentially
- Click **Clear** to reset the view

### Key Insights
- **68%** of data falls within ±1 standard deviation of the mean
- **95%** of data falls within ±2 standard deviations
- **99.7%** of data falls within ±3 standard deviations
- Values beyond 3σ are extremely rare (<0.3%)

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will apply the 68-95-99.7 rule to estimate proportions and identify unusual values in normally distributed data (Bloom's Taxonomy: Applying, Evaluating).
