## About This MicroSim

Compare distributions across multiple groups using side-by-side boxplots.

### How to Use
- Select different **datasets** to explore various comparison scenarios
- **Click** on a boxplot to see its detailed five-number summary
- Toggle **Show Outliers** to display individual outlier points
- Toggle **Connect Medians** to visually compare centers across groups

### What to Compare
- **Centers**: Which group has the highest/lowest median?
- **Spreads**: Which group has the most/least variability (widest/narrowest box)?
- **Shapes**: Are some distributions symmetric while others are skewed?
- **Outliers**: Does one group have more unusual values?

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective
Students will compare distributions across multiple groups by analyzing side-by-side boxplots (Bloom's Taxonomy: Analyzing, Evaluating).
