## About This MicroSim

*"Let's crack this nut!"* Sylvia says with determination. *"The four-step process is your roadmap for EVERY inference problem on the AP exam. Master this, and you'll never lose points for missing steps!"*

This interactive flowchart guides you through the essential four-step process:

### The Four Steps

| Step | Color | Purpose | Key Action |
|------|-------|---------|------------|
| **STATE** | Green | Define the problem | Write hypotheses or identify parameter |
| **PLAN** | Blue | Check conditions | Verify Random, Independent, Normal |
| **DO** | Orange | Calculate | Compute test statistic or interval |
| **CONCLUDE** | Purple | State conclusion | Answer in context |

## How to Use

1. **Click each step** to see detailed requirements
2. **Toggle between modes** (Hypothesis Test vs. Confidence Interval)
3. **Review the checklist** for what to include
4. **Read Sylvia's tips** at the bottom of each step

## Key Insights

*"Here's the thing about AP graders,"* Sylvia explains seriously. *"They use rubrics. Each step has specific elements they're looking for. Skip a step? Lose points. It's that simple."*

### The Mnemonic

**"Some People Don't Care"** = **S**tate, **P**lan, **D**o, **C**onclude

(But trust me, AP graders DEFINITELY care!)

### Common Mistakes by Step

| Step | Common Mistake | How to Avoid |
|------|----------------|--------------|
| STATE | Forgetting to define the parameter | Always identify what μ or p represents |
| PLAN | Skipping condition checks | Use a checklist: Random, Independent, Normal |
| DO | Not showing work | Write formulas before substituting values |
| CONCLUDE | Generic conclusion | Include the specific context from the problem |

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this activity, students will be able to:

1. Execute the complete four-step process for hypothesis tests
2. Execute the complete four-step process for confidence intervals
3. Identify the required elements of each step
4. Distinguish between hypothesis test and confidence interval requirements
5. Avoid common errors that cost points on the AP exam

### Target Audience

- AP Statistics students (high school)
- Students preparing for the AP Statistics exam
- Anyone learning statistical inference procedures

### Prerequisites

- Understanding of hypothesis testing concepts
- Understanding of confidence interval concepts
- Familiarity with checking conditions for inference

### Classroom Activities

**Activity 1: Step-by-Step Walkthrough (20 minutes)**

Work through a complete problem together, clicking each step as you go:

*Problem*: A random sample of 150 customers found that 42 preferred the new design. Test whether more than 25% prefer the new design at α = 0.05.

For each step:
1. Click the step
2. Review the checklist
3. Write the required elements
4. Check off each item

**Activity 2: Find the Missing Step (10 minutes)**

Present incomplete solutions and have students identify:
- Which step is missing?
- What specific elements are missing?
- How many points might be lost?

**Activity 3: Mode Comparison (10 minutes)**

Toggle between Hypothesis Test and Confidence Interval modes:
- What's different about STATE?
- What's the same about PLAN?
- How does CONCLUDE differ?

*"Don't worry—every statistician drops an acorn sometimes,"* Sylvia reassures. *"The four-step process is like training wheels. Once you've used it enough, it becomes second nature!"*

### Assessment Questions

1. A student writes: "Since p = 0.03 < 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis." What step is this, and what's missing?

2. Why is it important to check conditions BEFORE doing calculations?

3. What's the difference between the CONCLUDE step for a hypothesis test vs. a confidence interval?

4. A student concludes "There is a significant difference." What's wrong with this conclusion?

5. Rewrite the following conclusion properly: "The null hypothesis is accepted because p = 0.15."
