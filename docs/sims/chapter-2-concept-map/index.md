## Description

This interactive concept map provides a visual overview of all the key concepts covered in Chapter 2: Displaying Categorical Data. The hierarchical structure shows how concepts relate to each other and builds understanding of the chapter's organization.

### Main Branches

The concept map has four main branches stemming from the root concept:

1. **Organizing Data** (Blue) - Methods for arranging raw categorical data
   - Frequency Table
   - Relative Frequency
   - Cumulative Frequency

2. **Single Variable Displays** (Green) - Visual representations for one variable
   - Bar Graph
   - Pie Chart

3. **Two Variable Analysis** (Orange) - Examining relationships between two categorical variables
   - Two-Way Table
     - Marginal Distribution
     - Conditional Distribution

4. **Association** (Purple) - Understanding relationships between variables
   - Direction (Positive / Negative)
   - Strength

### Interactive Features

- **Hover** over any node to see its definition in a tooltip
- **Click** on a node to highlight its branch (ancestors and descendants) while dimming other nodes
- **Click again** on the same node or anywhere else to clear the selection and show all branches
- **Color-coded branches** help distinguish between different concept themes

The color scheme reinforces the organization:

- Blue nodes relate to organizing and summarizing data
- Green nodes represent graphical displays
- Orange nodes cover two-variable analysis
- Purple nodes deal with association concepts

## Lesson Plan

### Learning Objective

Students will identify and recognize the key concepts in Chapter 2 and understand how they relate to each other in a hierarchical structure.

### Bloom's Taxonomy Level

Remember (L1) - Recognize, identify

### Grade Level

High School (AP Statistics) or Undergraduate Introduction to Statistics

### Prerequisites

- Reading of Chapter 2 introduction
- Basic understanding of what categorical data means

### Duration

10-15 minutes

### Activities

1. **Orientation (3 minutes)**: Have students explore the concept map by hovering over each main branch to understand the four major themes of the chapter.

2. **Concept Exploration (5 minutes)**: Students click on each main branch one at a time to focus on that section. For each branch, have them:
   - Read the definitions of all concepts in that branch
   - Identify which concepts are sub-concepts of others
   - Note any concepts they want to learn more about

3. **Connection Building (5 minutes)**: Ask students to consider:
   - Which organizing method (frequency table, relative frequency, cumulative frequency) might be used with which display?
   - How does a two-way table connect to the idea of association?
   - Why are "direction" and "strength" important when describing associations?

4. **Preview Discussion (2 minutes)**: Use the concept map to preview the chapter structure and set expectations for what students will learn.

### Assessment Questions

1. What are the four main branches of concepts in Chapter 2?
2. What is the difference between marginal and conditional distribution?
3. Name two ways to display a single categorical variable.
4. What two aspects describe an association between variables?

### Extension

Have students return to this concept map after completing the chapter and see if they can now explain each concept without looking at the definitions.
