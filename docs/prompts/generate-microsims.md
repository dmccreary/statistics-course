# Generate MicroSims

Run the /microsim-genenerator skill in parallel on all of the #### Diagram elements in chapters 4 and 5.
Use the content of the <details markdown="1"> element to get the MicroSim specification for each
diagram.  Remember to place the iframe after the #### Diagram header and before the <details markdown="1">
in the chapter content when done.

When generating the index.md file, remember to place the link to Edit in the p5.js Editor if the
MicroSim was a p5.js MicroSim.
