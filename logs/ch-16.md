**Execution Mode:** Sequential (single chapter)

## Chapter Information

**Title:** Hypothesis Testing

**Summary:** This chapter introduces hypothesis testing, the other main branch of statistical inference. Students will learn to formulate null and alternative hypotheses, calculate and interpret p-values, understand Type I and Type II errors, and make conclusions based on statistical evidence. These skills enable students to test claims about population parameters using sample data.

## Issues and Notes

1. **Word count exceeded target:** The chapter contains 22 concepts, which is significantly more than typical chapters. Comprehensive coverage required additional content. The extended length is justified by the foundational importance of hypothesis testing in AP Statistics.

2. **MicroSim specifications:** Five detailed MicroSim specifications were created. These require implementation by the microsim-generator skill.

3. **Formula density:** This chapter is more formula-heavy than typical due to the mathematical nature of hypothesis testing. Additional effort was made to balance formulas with intuitive explanations and analogies.

4. **Court trial analogy:** Used the "innocent until proven guilty" analogy extensively as it's pedagogically effective and commonly used in AP Statistics instruction.
