## Content Summary

This chapter covers two major inference techniques for the AP Statistics curriculum:

### Part 1: Chi-Square Tests (Concepts 265-278)
- **Chi-Square Distribution**: Properties, shape, degrees of freedom
- **Observed vs Expected Counts**: Calculation methods for different test types
- **Chi-Square Statistic**: Formula breakdown and interpretation
- **Conditions**: Random, Independent, Large Counts (expected >= 5)
- **Goodness-of-Fit Test**: Hypotheses, df = k-1, conclusion template
- **Test for Homogeneity**: Two-way tables, comparing distributions across groups
- **Test for Independence**: Single sample, two variables, association testing
- **Chi-Square Conclusions**: Four-step process, template language

### Part 2: Regression Inference (Concepts 279, 282-283, 285-289)
- **Inference for Slope**: Population model, sample estimates
- **LINE Conditions**: Linearity, Independence, Normality, Equal variance
- **T-Test for Slope**: Test statistic formula, df = n-2, reading computer output
- **T-Interval for Slope**: Confidence interval construction and interpretation
- **Complete Worked Example**: Coffee shop temperature vs iced drink sales
