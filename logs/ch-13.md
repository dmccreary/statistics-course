## Chapter Information

**Title:** Random Variables

**Summary:** This chapter introduces random variables and probability distributions. Students will learn about discrete random variables, expected value, variance, and standard deviation. The binomial and geometric distributions are covered in depth as key examples of discrete probability models used throughout statistics.

**Reading Level:** Senior High (Grades 10-12)

**Target Audience:** High school students preparing for AP Statistics

## Issues and Notes

### No Issues Encountered

The chapter generation completed successfully with no errors.

### Notes

1. **LaTeX Formatting:** All equations use backslash delimiters (`\(` `\)` for inline, `\[` `\]` for display) as required by project conventions.

2. **Non-Text Elements:** Maintained the guideline of no more than 3 paragraphs of pure text without a non-text element. The chapter includes diverse element types (lists, tables, diagrams, MicroSims, admonitions).

3. **Pedagogical Ordering:** Concepts were presented in pedagogical order rather than strictly following the numbered concept list:
   - Started with random variable definition
   - Progressed through probability distributions
   - Built up to expected value and variance
   - Covered linear transformations and combinations
   - Concluded with binomial and geometric distributions

4. **Calculator Instructions:** Included TI-83/84 calculator commands for binomial probabilities as relevant for AP Statistics preparation.

5. **BINS Mnemonic:** Introduced the BINS mnemonic (Binary, Independent, Number fixed, Same probability) to help students remember binomial conditions.
