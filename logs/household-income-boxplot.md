# Household Income Boxplot MicroSim Session Log

Date: 2026-02-07
Repository: /Users/dan/Documents/ws/statistics-course

## Request
Create a MicroSim using the microsim-generator skill and Plotly guide for:
"Household Incomes in a City" (right-skewed boxplot, long upper whisker, median near Q1, compact box, compare mean vs median).

## Instructional Design Check
- Bloom Level: Analyze (L4)
- Bloom Verb: Interpret
- Recommended Pattern: Parameter sliders with immediate visual feedback
- Specification Alignment: Aligned
- Rationale: Sliders let learners compare skew, whisker length, and mean vs median directly.

## Work Completed
Created a Plotly-based MicroSim showing a right-skewed income distribution with controls for:
- Household count
- Median income
- Inequality (spread)
- High-income outlier toggle
- Show individual points
- Show mean marker
- Regenerate sample
