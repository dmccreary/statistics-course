3. **Interactive Histogram Explorer** (Analyze, L4) - Adjust bin width to observe effects
4. **Symmetric Distribution Identifier** (Remember, L1) - Recognize symmetric vs asymmetric
5. **Skewness Explorer** (Understand, L2) - Classify distribution skewness
6. **Distribution Shape Gallery** (Remember, L1) - Compare unimodal, bimodal, uniform
7. **Outlier Detective Game** (Analyze, L4) - Identify outliers in context
8. **SOCS Description Builder** (Create, L6) - Compose distribution descriptions
