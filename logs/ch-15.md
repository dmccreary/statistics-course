## Chapter Information

### Title
Confidence Intervals

### Summary
This chapter introduces confidence intervals as a method of estimation in statistical inference. Students will learn to construct and interpret confidence intervals for proportions, understand margin of error and confidence level, and determine appropriate sample sizes. Confidence intervals quantify the uncertainty inherent in using sample data to estimate population parameters.

## Notes and Observations

### Content Highlights

1. **Strong conceptual foundation**: The chapter builds from point estimates to interval estimates to confidence intervals in a logical progression

2. **Common misconception addressed**: Heavy emphasis on the correct interpretation of confidence level (long-run frequency, not probability for a single interval)

3. **AP Exam alignment**: Includes condition checking requirements and interpretation templates that align with AP Statistics exam expectations

4. **Sylvia integration**: Multiple appearances of Sylvia the Statistical Squirrel with signature phrases ("Let's crack this nut!", "Acorn for your thoughts?", "Time to squirrel away this knowledge!")

5. **Practical applications**: Real-world examples including voter polls, social media usage, and student surveys

### MicroSim Design Notes

- All MicroSims designed with canvas-based controls (no DOM elements) per project requirements
- Bloom's Taxonomy levels span Remember (L1) through Analyze (L4)
- Each specification includes Instructional Rationale explaining pedagogical design choices
- All MicroSims designed to be responsive

### Formula Presentation

- All LaTeX equations use backslash delimiters (\( \) for inline, \[ \] for display) as required
- Key formulas collected in a reference table at end of chapter

### Prerequisites Verification

The chapter appropriately references:
- Chapter 5 (Standardization and Normal) for z-scores and normal distribution
- Chapter 14 (Sampling Distributions) for sampling variability concepts
