## Notes and Issues

### Tone and Style
- Content follows the fun, encouraging, conversational tone specified in CLAUDE.md
- Sylvia the Statistical Squirrel appears in admonitions throughout the chapter
- Used her signature phrases: "squirrel away," "tail tingling," etc.
- Maintained balance of warmth without being condescending

### Math Formatting
- All equations use backslash delimiters as specified (\( \) and \[ \])
- No dollar sign delimiters used
- Equations include: Cohen's d formula, margin of error formula, t-test calculation

### Mascot Integration
- Sylvia appears in 5 admonitions with appropriate context
- Final admonition includes her signature squirrel emoji as a celebration
- References her backstory naturally (data-driven thinking)

### AP Exam Focus
- Strong emphasis on the Four-Step Process (State, Plan, Do, Conclude)
- Mnemonic provided: "Some People Don't Care"
- Common point-losers highlighted in tables
- Time management strategies included
- Practice problems with hidden answers (collapsible admonitions)

### Special Features
- Complete worked example showing full statistical investigation
- Comparison of poor vs. good statistical writing
- Key phrases table for hypothesis testing conclusions
- Audience-specific communication guidance

## Quality Checks

- [x] No more than 3 paragraphs without non-text element
- [x] Diverse element types used (lists, tables, diagrams, MicroSims, infographics)
- [x] Concepts presented in pedagogical order
- [x] All concepts from "Concepts Covered" addressed
- [x] Blank lines before all lists and tables
- [x] Level 4 headers before all details blocks
- [x] Metadata added to top of file
- [x] Reading level appropriate for Senior High
- [x] No navigation.tabs in mkdocs.yml (per CLAUDE.md)
