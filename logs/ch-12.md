# Chapter 12: Experimental Design - Generation Log

**Skill Version:** 0.04
**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Execution Mode:** Sequential (single chapter)

## 1. Chapter Title and Summary

**Title:** Experimental Design

**Summary:** This chapter covers the principles of designing experiments to establish causal relationships. Students learn about experimental units, treatments, factors, and levels. Key principles include control, randomization, replication, and blinding. Understanding good experimental design enables students to critically evaluate scientific claims.

## 5. Issues and Notes

### Notes

1. **Sylvia Integration:** Successfully integrated Sylvia the Statistical Squirrel as narrative anchor with:
   - Opening chapter dialogue
   - Acorn-related analogies (storage experiments, collection bias)
   - Signature phrases ("Time to squirrel away this knowledge!")
   - Pro tips and warnings in admonitions
   - Closing encouragement

2. **Reading Level:** Content adapted for Senior High (Grades 10-12) per course description:
   - Sentence length: 15-22 words average
   - Technical vocabulary introduced with definitions
   - Balance of concrete examples and abstract concepts
   - Real-world scenarios (drug trials, educational interventions)

3. **AP Exam Focus:** Included dedicated section on how to describe experimental designs for the AP Statistics exam with template and example response.

4. **Tone:** Maintained warm, encouraging, conversational tone per CLAUDE.md guidelines:
   - Used contractions naturally
   - Addressed readers directly with "you" and "we"
   - Acknowledged challenges while building confidence
   - Included light humor (approximately 1-2 per major section)

### No Issues Encountered

- Chapter outline was complete with title, summary, and concepts list
- All 18 concepts from the learning graph were covered
- Prerequisites properly linked to Chapters 8 and 11
