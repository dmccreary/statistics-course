## Issues/Notes

- No glossary.md file found in the project; definitions provided inline
- Three regression-related concepts (280, 281, 284) were included per the chapter outline but could warrant their own dedicated chapter in a future revision
- MicroSim iframe paths use `../../sims/` pattern assuming standard project structure
