Which display type would be most appropriate?</p> <p>Answer: A histogram would be most appropriate. With 200 observations, a dotplot would be too crowded (200 stacked dots!) and a stemplot would have too many leaves. A histogram efficiently summarizes this larger dataset while still showing the overall shape.</p> Question 2: Identify the skewness <p>A dataset of annual income for residents of a city shows most people earning between $35,000 and $75,000, with a small number of residents earning over $500,000. What is the likely shape of this distribution?</p> <p>Answer: This distribution is skewed right (positively skewed). The main cluster of values is at the lower end (\\(35,000-\\)75,000), with a long tail stretching toward the high-income outliers above $500,000. Remember: the skew direction matches where the tail goes, not where most values are.</p> Question 3: Is this an outlier? <p>In a dataset of marathon finish times, most runners complete the race between 3.5 and 5.5 hours. One runner finished in 2.1 hours. Is this an outlier? Should it be removed?</p> <p>Answer: Yes, 2.1 hours is an outlier because it's notably separated from the main cluster of finish times. However, it should NOT be removed! This is likely a legitimate value, an elite runner who finished much faster than recreational runners. This outlier tells us something important about the composition of the race participants.</p> Question 4: Bimodal or not? <p>A histogram of heights for a co-ed volleyball team shows two peaks: one around 5'6\" and another around 6'2\". Is this bimodal distribution surprising? What might explain it?</p> <p>Answer: This bimodal distribution is not surprising at all! The two peaks likely represent the two different populations mixed in the dataset: female players (clustering around 5'6\") and male players (clustering around 6'2\"). When you see a bimodal distribution, ask yourself: \"Could this be two groups combined?\" In this case, it clearly is.</p>"},{"location":"chapters/04-numerical-summaries/","title":"Numerical Summaries","text":""},{"location":"chapters/04-numerical-summaries/#summary","title":"Summary","text":"<p>This chapter introduces the numerical measures used to describe distributions.
